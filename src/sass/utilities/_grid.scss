 *
 * The grid utility partials define reusable grid-based utility classes used to
 * establish layout structure across the project. These utilities provide
 * lightweight, non-component-specific helpers for creating common grid
 * patterns such as equal columns, responsive stacks, and controlled spacing.
 *
 * Grid utilities are intended to be compostable and context-agnostic, allowing
 * layouts to be constructed quickly without introducing additional component
 * styles or bespoke CSS. Spacing, column counts, and alignment behaviour are
 * typically driven by CSS custom properties or predefined modifers to ensure
 * consistency with the overall design system.
 *
 * These grid utility classes should remain purely structual and must not
 * contain visual or thematic styling. Component-specific layouts belong within
 * their respective partials, while these utilities act as foundational
 * primitives that can be safely reused throughout the project.
