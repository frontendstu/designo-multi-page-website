 * ACCESSIBILITY
 *

 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Defines global accessibility-focused utility classes that enhance or
 * preserve access to content for assistive technologies without altering the
 * visual layout for sighted users.
 *
 * These utilities are designed to address specific accessibility patterns such
 * as providing screen-reader-only content, revealing alternative text in focus
 * contexts, and supporting non-visual navigation.
 *
 * Classes defined here are intentionally minimal, and non-visual. Their sole
 * purpose is to improve the usability of the interface for users of screen
 * readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies.
 *
 * Utilities in this partial should not introduce aesthetic styling and should
 * remained focused on semantic, navigational, or preceptual accessibility
 * needs. Additional visual styling or component specific behaviour should be
 * handled elsewhere to maintain clear separation of responsibilities.
