 * ACCESSIBILITY
 *
 * Version: 1.0.0 (11/01/2026)
 * Author: Stu Cowley
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Defines global accessibility-focused utility classes that enhance or
 * preserve access to content for assistive technologies without altering the
 * visual layout for sighted users.
 *
 * These utilities are designed to address specific accessibility patterns such
 * as providing screen-reader-only content, revealing alternative text in focus
 * contexts, and supporting non-visual navigation.
 *
 * Classes defined here are intentionally minimal, and non-visual. Their sole
 * purpose is to improve the usability of the interface for users of screen
 * readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies.
 *
 * Utilities in this partial should not introduce aesthetic styling and should
 * remained focused on semantic, navigational, or preceptual accessibility
 * needs. Additional visual styling or component specific behaviour should be
 * handled elsewhere to maintain clear separation of responsibilities.

/**
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SCREEN READER ONLY
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The `.sr-only` utility class hides content visually while keeping it
 * available to assistive technologies such as screen readers. This allows
 * non-visual users to access contextual information(e.g. descriptive labels,
 * accessibility hints, or expand control text) without affecting the visible
 * layout.
 *
 * This technique relies on positioning and clipping to remove content from the
 * visual rendering surface while maintaining it in the accessibility tree. It
 * is appropriate for content that should remain semantically meaningful but
 * does not need to be presented visually.
 *
 * For content that should become visible when focused via a keyboard
 * navigation, consider paring with corresponding "focus-reveal" utility rather
 * than `.sr-only` alone.

 * FOCUS REVEAL
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The `.focus-reveal` utility class hides content visually while keeping it
 * available to screen readers, but allows the content to become visible when
 * focused via keyboard navigation.
 *
 * This utility is typically used for skip links or interactive controls that
 * should only appear when keyboard users need them, while remaining invisible
 * during pointer-based interaction.
