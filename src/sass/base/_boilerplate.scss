 *
 * Sets the base styles that establishes the baseline behaviour of the project.
 *
 * These boilerplate styles define low-level, opinionated defaults that apply
 * broadly across the site, such as box-sizing rules and default element
 * behaviours.
 *
 * These styles are intentionally global and are applied early in the
 * stylesheet to ensure a consistent and predictable foundation for all
 * components and layouts.
