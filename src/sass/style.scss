 *
 * Description:
 * This is my attempt at the Designo Multi-Page Website, a multi page website 
 * that features 7 responsive pages designs that make for an intersting 
 * challange and I look forward to seeing what I can come up with.
 *
 * As this is a large project, I have decided that I will be using Sass instead 
 * of CSS. I find that CSS can become quite tricky to quickly navigate for 
 * larger projects.
