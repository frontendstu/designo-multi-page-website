 *
 * Defines all container-related styles used to constrain and align content
 * across the site.
 *
 * Containers establish consistent horizontal and vertical boundries for
 * layouts, ensuring content remains readable, visually balanced, and centered
 * within the viewport across a range of screen sizes. Where appropriate,
 * containers may apply minimal internal padding to prevent content from
 * touching the edges of the viewport at narrower widths.
 *
 * Container styles are structual in nature and should remain free of visual
 * styling such as colours, typography or component-specific spacing. Their
 * sole responsibility is to define layout boundries and content flow.

 * CONTAINER
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Defines the core container class used to constrain the maximum width of site
 * content and centre it within the viewport.
 *
 * The container establishes a consistent horizontal boundary for layouts,
 * ensuring content remains readable and visually aligned across screen sizes.
 * A small amount of padding is applied to prevent content from touching the
 * edges of the viewport at narrower widths.
 *
 * Container media queries for different viewport widths are defined in the
 * `:root` and can be adjusted there.
