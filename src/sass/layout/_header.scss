 * HEADER

 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Defines the global header, including its structual layout, positioning and
 * interaction-related styles.
 *
 * The header provides persistent access to core site navigation and branding,
 * and is responsible for maintaining clear usability across varying screen
 * sizes and device types. Styles defined here ensure that the header remains
 * visually consistent, accessible and functionally predictable throughout the
 * site experience.
 *
 * The header partial acts as the central location for header-specific patterns
 * such as branding alignment, navigation layout, responsiveness, and any
 * supporting interactive components (e.g. mobile menus). Visual styling
 * specific to child components should be defined in their respective partials
 * in order to preserve clarity and seperation of concerns.
 *
 * Header styles are intended to remain global and non-contextual. Page-level
 * orverrrides should be avoided unless strictly necessary, and implemented
 * with care to maintain predictable behaviour across the design system.
