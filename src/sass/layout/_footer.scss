 * FOOTER
 *
 * Version: 1.0.0 (04/02/2026)
 * Author: Stu Cowley
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Defines the global footer, including its structual layout, positioning and
 * interaction-related styles.
 *
 * The footer provides persistent access to core site navigation, branding,
 * contact information and social media contacts. The footer is responsible for
 * maintaining clear usability across varying screen sizes and devices types.
 * Styles defined here ensure that the footer remains visually consistent,
 * accessible and functionally predictable throughout the site experience.
 *
 * Footer styles are intended to remain global and non-contextual. Page-level
 * overrides should be avoided unless strictly necessary, and implemented with
 * care to maintain predictable behaviour across the design system.
