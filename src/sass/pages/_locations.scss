 *
 * The locations partial defines the styles specific to the Locations page.
 *
 * It defines page-level spacing, section rhythm, and the Locations grid on
 * larger viewports. These styles are tightly coupled to the structure of the
 * Locations page and are not intended for reuse elsewhere in the project.
