 *
 * The home partial defines the styles specific to the Home page, these styles
 * include the portfolio navigation grid and features section.
 *
 * The portfolio navigation grid provides quick access to the portfolio
 * categories and is styled to maintain strong visual hierarchy and consistent
 * card presentation across breakpoints. The style features an image with the
 * portfolio category name overlayed on top of the image.
 *
 * Styles defined here are context-specific to the Home page and should not
 * contain any global component styles. Shared patterns (e.g. cards, buttons,
 * grids, or layout primitives) should be maintained in their respective
 * location support reuse across the design system.
