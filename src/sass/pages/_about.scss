 *
 * The About partial defines the styles specific to the About page.
 *
 * This includes page-level layout, section spacing and About page specific
 * components such as the `.about-card` and supporting content blocks. These
 * styles are tightly coupled to the About page structure and are not for reuse
 * across other areas of the site.
 *
 * Reusable patterns should be abstracted into the components directory where
 * appropriate. Page-specific implementations should remain scoped here.
