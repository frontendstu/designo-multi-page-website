 * BUTTONS

 *
 * This partial defines all global button styles used throughout the site.
 *
 * It establishes the core `.btn` class, which provides the foundational button
 * structure including layout, spacing, typography and interaction behaviour.
 * This ensures all buttons are share a consistent baseline regardless of
 * content or implementation.
 *
 * In addition to the base button setup, the two button variants are also
 * defined to be used across the design system:
 *
 * - Button On Dark  (`.btn-on-dark`)
 * - Button On Light (`.btn-on-light`)
 *
 * Button styles defined here are global and reusable. Component-specific or
 * one-off button adjustments should be avoided and handled at the component
 * level only when absolutely necessary.
