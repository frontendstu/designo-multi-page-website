 * HERO

 *
 * The Hero partial defines the styles for the global hero component, which
 * serves as the primary introductory section for a page or view.
 *
 * The Hero is responsible for establishing strong visual hierarchy by pairing
 * headline content with a supporting message. It often acts as the first point
 * of engagement for users, and it includes typography and background pattern
 * imagery.
 *
 * Styles defined in this Hero partial focus on layout, spacing, responsive
 * behaviour, and visual composition specific to the Hero pattern.
 * Component-focused values such as typography and button usage are layered on
 * top of global custom properties and foundations defined in the variables
 * partial.
 *
 * Variants or alternate Hero formats (e.g., home page hero) are defined in
 * this partial instead of the home page partial to preserve consistency and
 * avoid duplication across the project.
