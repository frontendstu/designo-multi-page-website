 * LOCATIONS
 *
 * Version: 1.0.0 (12/02/2026)
 * Author: Stu Cowley
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Defines the Locations component used to highlight regional office locations.
 *
 * Each location item pairs a decorative landmark illustration and background
 * pattern (circle) and a call-to-action button linking to the Locations page.
 *
 * The layout follows a mobile-first approach:
 * - Single-column stack on base and tablet (768px) viewports
 * - Changes to a three-column grid at desktop (1280px) viewport
 *
 * Spacing, typography and layout behaviour are controlled via design tokens
 * and utility mixins to ensure consistency across breakpoints.
