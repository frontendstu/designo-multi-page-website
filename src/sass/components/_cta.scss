 * CALL TO ACTION

 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The Call to Action (CTA) partial defines the styles for the global call to
 * action component, which is used to prompt users toward high-value
 * interaction such as contacting the business.
 *
 * The CTA component is designed to stand out from surrounding content through
 * controlled contrast, spacing, and clear typographic hierarchy which still
 * aligning with the overall design system. Layout, padding and responsive
 * behaviour are managed here, while colour and typography values are driven by
 * global tokens to maintain consistency across the interface.
 *
 * The file should contain only CTA-specific styling. Shared button logic,
 * layout primatives, and typographic foundations should remain within their
 * respective global partials to preserver seperation of concerns and encourage
 * reuse.
 *
 * Variants or contextual adaptations (e.g., light, dark, or inline CTA
 * formats) should be defined within this partial to ensure predictable
 * behaviour and avoid duplication across views.
